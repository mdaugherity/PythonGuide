# Python Guide
Welcome to Python Guide by the Abilene Christian University Department of Engineering and Physics.

# Introduction - START HERE
Completely new to Python and Google Colab?  Start here.

PLACEHOLDER for starting lessons (maybe with youtube videos?).  These should be short (<10 minutes) and could be assigned for class.
* Lesson 1 - Welcome to Google Colab
* Lesson 2 - Python Basics
* Lesson 3 - Calculations with numpy
* Lesson 4 - Plots with matplotlib

# Basics
Quick introductions to things

# How Do I?
Look in the sections below for quick, easy to use examples of how to do the things you want to do

## Math
Solving Equations Numerically
* Find the value of a variable with root finding 
* Solve a linear system
* Solve a non-linear system  

Fitting and Interpolation
* Fit a straight line to data with polyfit
* Fit a general equation to data with *scipy.optimize.curve_fit*
* Interpolating values between data points with *numpy.interp*
* Advanced fitting with global optimizers

Calculus
* Find (numerical) derivatives
* Find integral of data points
* Find integral of a function with *scipy.integrate.quad* 

Differential Equations
* Solve an ODE with *scipy.integrate.solve_ivp*
